I am a PhD student of [Wolfgang LÃ¼ck](https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/lueck/) at the University of Bonn and the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics.

My research interests lie in algebraic and geometric topology.
More specifically, I am thinking about algebraic $ K $- and $ L $-theory and their relation to the topology of manifolds.
I am also intersted in $L^2$-invariants.
