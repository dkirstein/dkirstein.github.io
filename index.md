Starting in October 2025, I will be a postdoc at LMU Munich in the research group of [Markus Land](https://www.markus-land.de/).
Before that, I completed my PhD at the University of Bonn and the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, working under the supervision [Wolfgang Lück](https://him-lueck.uni-bonn.de/).

My research interests lie in homotopy theory and geometric topology.
More specifically, I am working on algebraic $K$- and $L$-theory as well as moduli of (equivariant) manifolds.
