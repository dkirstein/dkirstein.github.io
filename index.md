I am a PhD student at the University of Bonn and the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics. My advisor is [Wolfgang LÃ¼ck](https://him-lueck.uni-bonn.de/).

My research interests lie in algebraic and geometric topology and homotopy theory.
More specifically, I am thinking about algebraic $ K $- and $ L $-theory, equivariant homotopy theory and their interplay with the topology of manifolds.
I am also intersted in $L^2$-invariants.
