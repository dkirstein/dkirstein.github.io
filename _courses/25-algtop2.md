**Assistent**: [Dominik Kirstein](https://dkirstein.github.io)

# Content
This lecture course is the last part of a series of five lecture courses about topology.
It will cover the following topics with emphasis on the third one:
- Bordism Theory
- Pontrjagin Thom construction
- Spectral sequences and their applications to (co-)homology and homotopy
- Principal G-bundles and characteristic classes
- Group (co-)homology

To follow the course, one has to be familiar with the material covered in the previous courses [Algebraic Topology 1](https://dkirstein.github.io/courses/2425-algtop1) (Winter 24/25) and [Topology 2](https://sites.google.com/view/christian-kremer-math/teaching/topology-2-ss-24) (Summer 24).

# Literature
We will not be following a specific book. There are many good sources, e.g.:
- Hatcher: *Algebraic topology*
- tom Dieck: *Algebraic topology*
- Switzer: *Algebraic toplogy - homotopy and homology*
- Weibel: *An introduction to homological algebra*
- Whitehead: *Elements of homotopy theory*

We will provide [lecture notes](https://him-lueck.uni-bonn.de/data/script_AlgTop_www.pdf) for the course.

# Exams
There will be oral exams at the end of the course.
The first round is scheduled for July 14 - July 24 and the second round for August 19 - August 22.

# Exercises
There will be weekly exercise sheets, which the students can submit in teams of at most three.
The solutions will partially be discussed in the tutorials.
To be admitted to the final exam, students have to collect at least 50% of possible points on the exercise sheets and sucessfully present the solution to one of the exercises in the tutorial.

You can sign up for the exercise groups on [eCampus](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_crs_3666791.html).
